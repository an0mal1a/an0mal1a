# üëã Hey, im An0mal1a

A **cybersecurity** and **programming** enthusiast, with special interest in both **offensive** and **defensive** research. I like to explore how systems work from the inside, break them (ethically), and learn how to better protect them.

üîê **Offensive & defensive security**.  
üíª **Low level programming (C, ASM)**.  
‚öôÔ∏è **Reversing, development of tools and automation**

## üõ†Ô∏è Highlighted projects

Here you will find a variety of personal projects and tools that I have developed as part of my training and passion for computer security. Some are public, others more advanced and for responsible use are kept private.

üß™ I have worked in:

- Analysis and exploitation tools
- Automation scripts for pentesting
- Proofs of concept on evasion and detection
- An advanced private project: a **Remote Access Tool (RAT)** in **C**, focused on educational purposes and ethical control of simulated environments.

> üß† **Note**: All code and knowledge sharing is oriented towards **research, education and responsible development** within the legal framework.
